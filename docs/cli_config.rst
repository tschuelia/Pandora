Pandora Command Line Interface Configuration
============================================

Configuration options:
----------------------

- ``dataset_prefix``, File path prefix pointing to the dataset to use for the Pandora analyses. Pandora will look for files called .* so make sure all files have the same prefix.
- ``result_dir``, Directory where to store all (intermediate) results to.
- ``file_format``, default = ``EIGENSTRAT``, Name of the file format your dataset is in. Supported formats are ``ANCESTRYMAP``, ``EIGENSTRAT``, ``PED``, ``PACKEDPED``, ``PACKEDANCESTRYMAP``. For more information see Section `Input data`_ below.
- ``convertf``, default = ``convertf``, File path pointing to an executable of Eigensoft's ``convertf`` tool. ``convertf`` is used if the provided dataset is not in ``EIGENSTRAT`` format. Default is ``convertf``. This will only work if ``convertf`` is installed systemwide.
- ``n_replicates``, default = 100, Number of bootstrap replicates or sliding windows to compute
- ``keep_replicates``, default = ``false``, Whether to store all intermediate datasets files (``.geno``, ``.snp``, ``.ind``). Note that this will result in a substantial storage consumption. Note that in case of bootstrapping, the bootstrapped indices are stored as checkpoints for full reproducibility in any case.
- ``n_components``, default = 10, Number of components to compute and compare for PCA or MDS analyses. We recommend 10 for PCA analyses and 2 for MDS analyses. The default is 10 since the default for ``embedding_algorithm`` is ``PCA``.
- ``embedding_algorithm``, default = ``PCA``, Dimensionality reduction technique you want to use. Allowed options are ``PCA`` and ``MDS``.
- ``smartpca``, default = ``smartpca``, File path pointing to an executable of Eigensoft's ``smartpca`` tool. ``smartpca`` is used for PCA analyses on the provided dataset. Default is ``smartpca``. This will only work if ``smartpca`` is installed systemwide.
- ``smartpca_optional_settings``, default = not set, Optional additional settings to use when performing PCA with ``smartpca``. See `SmartPCA`_ section below for more details.
- ``embedding_populations``, default = not set, File containing a new-line separated list of population names. Only these populations will be used for the dimensionality reduction. In case of PCA analyses, all remaining samples in the dataset will be projected onto the PCA results.
- ``support_value_rogue_cutoff``, default = 0.5, When plotting the support values, only samples with a support value lower than the ``support_value_rogue_cutoff`` will be annotated with their sample IDs. Note that all samples in the respective plot are color-coded according to their support value in any case.
- ``kmeans_k``, default = not set, Number of clusters k to use for K-Means clustering of the dimensionality reduction embeddings. If not set, the optimal number of clusters will be automatically determined according to the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC).
- ``analysis_mode``, default = ``BOOTSTRAP``, Whether to run bootstrap analysis or sliding-window analysis. Allowed options are ``BOOTSTRAP`` and ``SLIDING_WINDOW``.
- ``redo``, default = ``False``, Whether to rerun all analyses in case the results files from a previous run are already present. Careful: this will overwrite existing results!
- ``seed``, default = current unix timestamp, Seed to initialize the random number generator. This setting is recommended for reproducible analyses.
- ``threads``, default = number of system threads, Number of threads to use for the analysis.
- ``result_decimals``, default = 2, Number of decimals to round the stability scores and support values in the output.
- ``verbosity``, default = 1, Verbosity of the output logging of Pandora.

    - 0 = quiet, prints only errors and the results (loglevel = ``ERROR``)
    - 1 = verbose, prints all intermediate infos (loglevel = ``INFO``)
    - 2 = debug, prints intermediate infos and debug messages (loglevel = ``DEBUG``)

- ``plot_results``, default = ``False``, Whether to plot all dimensionality reduction results and sample support values.
- ``plot_dim_x``, default = 0, Dimension to plot on the x-axis. Note that the dimensions are zero-indexed. To plot the first dimension set ``plot_dim_x = 0``.
- ``plot_dim_y``, default = 1, Dimension to plot on the y-axis. Note that the dimensions are zero-indexed. To plot the second dimension set ``plot_dim_y = 1``.

.. _SmartPCA:

SmartPCA optional settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pandora supports all smartPCA commands, for a list of possible settings see the `SmartPCA documentation <https://github.com/DReichLab/EIG/blob/master/POPGEN/README>`__.
Not allowed are the following options: ``genotypename``, ``snpname``, ``indivname``, ``evecoutname``, ``evaloutname``, ``numoutevec``, ``maxpops``. Use the following schema to set the options:

.. code:: yaml

   smartpca_optional_settings:
     shrinkmode: YES
     numoutlieriter: 1


.. _Input data:

Input data
----------

Pandora supports a variety of different input formats. Basically, we support all file formats than can be converted to Eigensoft's Eigenstrat format using the ``convertf`` program. Pandora expects the three input files (SNP, GENO, IND files) to have the same prefix and the file endings should follow the convention according to the table below.

================= =============================
File Format       Expected file endings
================= =============================
Ancestrymap       ``.geno``, ``.ind``, ``.snp``
Eigenstrat        ``.geno``, ``.ind``, ``.snp``
PED               ``.ped``, ``.fam``, ``.map``
PackedPED         ``.bed``, ``.fam``, ``.bim``
PackedAncestrymap ``.geno``, ``.ind``, ``.snp``
================= =============================

Pandora performs its bootstrapping and sliding-window analyses file-based and makes use of the Eigenstrat format. Thus, all other file formats are automatically converted to Eigenstrat prior to the analyses using the ``convertf`` tool. Make sure to correctly set the ``convertf`` option in your config file before running Pandora.


Output files
------------

Running Pandora in the command line will produce a number of (intermediate) output files. In the following I will describe these files and their content. Note that the names of the files are all relative to the specified ``result_dir`` in the configuration file.

- ``pandora.log``: The main pandora log file. Everything you see in your terminal will also be written to this log file.
- ``pandora.yaml``: On program start, Pandora will save a verbose version of the configuration in this file. You can use this file to reproduce your results.
- ``pandora.txt``: Main results file. The summary of the Pandora run will be written to this file, including the Pandora Stability, Pandora Cluster Stability and the summary of the Pandora support values.
- ``pandora.replicates.csv``: Verbose comparison output. This file will contain the Pandora Stability and Pandora Cluster Stability for all pairwise results of bootstrap replicates/windows. Each row corresponds to one comparison with the first column indicating the indices of the compared bootstraps/windows.
- ``pandora.supportValues.csv``: This file contains the Pandora support value for all samples in the dataset. Each row corresponds to one sample. The csv has two columns: ``average`` and ``standard_deviation`` containing the mean and stdev of support values across all pairwise embedding comparisons.
- ``pandora.supportValues.pairwise.csv``: This file contains the Pandora support value for all samples in the dataset. Each row corresponds to one sample. For each pairwise comparison there is a column indicating the respective Pandora support value for each sample for this particular comparison.
- ``pandora.supportValues.projected.csv``: In case you specified a list of populations that should only be used for the PCA embedding, all remaining samples will be projected onto the resulting embedding. This file will contain the same support value data as ``pandora.supportValues.csv``, but only for projected samples.
- ``bootstrap/``: If you selected the bootstrap analyses, this directory will contain three files for each bootstrap replicate:

    - ``*.ckp``: Pandora checkpoint file that stores the random seed used for this bootstrap as well as the SNP indices.
    - ``*.eval``, ``*.evec``: The results of the ``smartpca`` PCA embedding.
    - In case you specified ``keep_bootstraps: true`` in your config, there will also be the bootstrapped dataset files (``*.geno``, ``*.snp``, ``*.ind``).
- ``plots/``: If you set ``plot_results: true`` in your config, this directory will contain all plots Pandora generated during the execution. The names of the files should be self-explanatory.
